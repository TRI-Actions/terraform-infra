# terraform-infra

## A custom GitHub Actions module for terraform-infra pipelines

This is a custom module for use by terraform-NAME-infra repositories, such as terraform-ss-core-infra, terraform-simm-infra, etc. Using this pipeline, you will create a pull request with your repo. The pull request of your repo will execute terraform fmt checks and show a plan. Comment `GithubDeploy` in order to deploy the changes from the terraform plan. Below is the format for your repo.

    └───terraform
        ├───Account_number_A.tf
        ├───Account_number_B.tf
        └───modules
            ├───Account_number_A
            |   └───terraform.tf
            ├───Account_number_B
            |   └───terraform.tf

The files under modules are where the pipeline will deploy your custom terraform modules. Anything you would like to deploy would be under these modules. This includes providers and other information.

Account_number_A.tf is customized as the following:
    module "module-name" {
      source = "./modules/Account_number_A"
    }


## Prerequisites
    - Terraform statefile bucket must be set up for use
    - All repos using this pipeline must have the name format terraform-NAME-infra. Any other format will cause issues


## Inputs

There are three inputs with this repo:

```
AWS_IAM_Role:
    description: 'Cross Account role arn to assume to deploy infrastructure'
    required: false
    type: String
  SSM_private_keys:
    description: "comma separated list of ssm key locations, no spaces"
    required: false
    type: String
  SSM_pat:
    description: "Location of pat token in SSM"
    required: false
    type: String
```

If no IAM role is set, it will use whatever is set by default.
SSM_private keys can have multiple key locations separated by a comma. 
SSM_pat can only use one personal access token location.

All variables can be omitted or used depending on the context.

## How to use in Actions Workflow:

```
jobs:
  pipeline:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: ${{ github.event.issue.pull_request && 'deploy' || 'plan' }}
    permissions: write-all
 
    steps:
      - name: run composite module
        uses: TRI-Actions/web-app-infra@main
        with:
          AWS_IAM_Role: arn:aws:iam::1234567890123:role/{IAM_ROLE_NAME}
          SSM_private_keys: /key/location/1,/key/location/2
          SSM_pat: /pat/location
```
